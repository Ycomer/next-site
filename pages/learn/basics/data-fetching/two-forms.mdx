};

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

> Every time you deploy your Next.js app on ZEIT Now (both preview and production deployments), it runs `next build` by default. This is when Static Generation happens.
>
> In development (when you run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), every page is pre-rendered on each request — even for pages that use Static Generation.

### Per-page Basis

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

### Our Recommendation: Use Static Generation

We recommend using **Static Generation** over Server-side Rendering for performance reasons. Statically generated pages can be cached by CDN to boost performance. However, in some cases, Server-side Rendering might be the only option.

In this lesson, we’ll focus on Static Generation. On the next page, we’ll talk about Static Generation **with and without data**.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
