import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'API Routes',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'api-routes',
  stepId: 'setup',
  subtitle: 'Setup'
}

### Download Starter Code (Optional)

**If you’re continuing from the previous lesson,** you can skip the following.

Otherwise, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
# If you prefer Yarn, you can use `yarn create` instead of `npm init`
npm init next-app nextjs-blog --example "https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-starter/tree/master/api-routes-starter"
cd nextjs-blog
# If you prefer Yarn, you can use `yarn dev` instead
npm run dev
```

Once you download your starter code, you should update:

- `public/images/profile.jpg` with your photo (Recommended: 400px width/height).
- `const name = '[Your Name]'` in `components/layout.js` with your name.
- `<p>[Your Self Introduction]</p>` in `pages/index.js` with your self introduction.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
