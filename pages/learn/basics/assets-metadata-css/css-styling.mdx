Let’s now talk about **CSS styling**.

As you can see, our index page ([localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) already has nice styling. If you take a look at `pages/index.js`, you should see the code like this:

```jsx
<style jsx>{`
  …
`}</style>
```

This is using a library called [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx). It’s a “CSS-in-JS” library — it lets you write CSS within a React component, and the CSS styles will be _scoped_ (other components won’t be affected).

Next.js has built-in support for [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx), but you can also use other popular CSS-in-JS libraries such as [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) by installing them separately.

### Writing or Importing CSS

CSS-in-JS is great, but we understand that many people prefer writing plain CSS or importing popular CSS libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Writing plain CSS instead of using CSS-in-JS can lead to smaller bundle size (we’ll talk about this later).

So in this lesson, we’ll talk about how to write or import CSS files in Next.js. We’ll also talk about Next.js’s built-in support for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Let’s dive in!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
