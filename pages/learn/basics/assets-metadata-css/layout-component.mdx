import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';
import Image from '../../../../components/image';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Assets, Metadata, and CSS',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'assets-metadata-css',
  stepId: 'layout-component',
  subtitle: 'Layout Component'
};

First, Let’s create a **Layout** component which will be common across all pages.

- Create a top-level directory called `components`.
- Inside, create a file called `Layout.js` with the following content:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

const Layout = ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;

export default Layout;
```

Then, in `pages/posts/first-post.js`, import `Layout` and make it the outer most component.

```jsx
import Layout from '../../components/Layout';

const FirstPost = () => <Layout>…</Layout>;
```

### Adding CSS

Now, let’s add some styles for `Layout`. To do so, we’ll use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), which lets you import CSS files in a React component.

Create a file called `Layout.module.css` in the `components` directory with the following content:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 768px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0rem 0.5rem;
}
```

> **Important:** To use this CSS Modules, the CSS file name must end with `.module.css`.

To use this in `Layout`, you need to:

- Import it as `styles`, and
- Use `styles.<class-name>` as `className`.
- In this case, the class name is `container`, so we’ll use `styles.container`:

```jsx
import styles from `./Layout.module.css`

const Layout = ({ children }) => (
  <div className={styles.container}>{children}</div>
)

export default Layout
```

If you go to [localhost:3000/posts/first-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post) now, you should see that the text is now inside a centered container:

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Layout"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/assets-metadata-css/layout.png"
  width={2008 / 2}
  height={486 / 2}
/>

### Automatically Generates Unique Class Names

Now, if you take a look at the HTML in your browser’s devtools, you’ll notice that the `div` tag has a class name that looks like `Layout_container__...`.

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Devtools"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/assets-metadata-css/devtools.png"
  width={1012 / 2}
  height={214 / 2}
/>

This is what CSS Modules does: _It automatically generates unique class names_. As long as you use CSS Modules, you don’t have to worry about class name collisions.

Furthermore, Next.js’s code splitting feature works on CSS Modules as well. It ensures the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for each page. This results in smaller bundle sizes.

CSS Modules are also more performant than many CSS-in-JS libraries because CSS Modules are evaluated and transformed by Webpack at **build time**. They also don’t create extra layers of React components.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
