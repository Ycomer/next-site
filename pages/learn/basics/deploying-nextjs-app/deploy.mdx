The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the **<PlatformLink />** platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

&#8203;<PlataformText /> is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & JAMstack deployment and Serverless Functions. We believe <PlataformText /> is the optimal place to deploy Next.js apps. You can start using it for _free_ — no credit card required.

### Create a <PlataformText /> Account

First, go to <PlatformLink href="/signup" /> to create a <PlataformText /> account. Choose **Continue with GitHub** and go through the sign up process.

### Import your `nextjs-blog` repository

Once you’re signed up, **import** your `nextjs-blog` repository on <PlataformText />. You can do so from here: <PlatformLink href="/import/git" />.

- You’ll need to **Install Now for GitHub**. You can give access to **All Repositories**.
- Once you’ve installed Now, import `nextjs-blog`.

You can use _default values_ for the following settings — no need to change anything. <PlataformText /> automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you.

- Project Name
- Root Directory
- Build Command
- Output Directory
- Development Command

When you deploy, your Next.js app will start building. It should finish in under a minute.

> **Help is available**: If your deployment fails, you can always get help on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/discussions). To learn more about deployment,

When it’s done, you’ll get deployment URLs ending with `now.sh`. Click on the URL that looks like below — this is the **production domain** assigned to your app:

`nextjs-blog.<username>.now.sh`

…and you should see the Next.js starter page live.

Congratulations! You just deployed your Next.js app to production.

Before we finish, let’s talk about:

- What actually happens behind the scenes when you deploy to <PlataformText />
- The **DPS** workflow: **D**evelop, **P**review, and **S**hip
- Other hosting options
